        <h1>The Introduction</h1>
        <img src="../src/IntroductionFalloutImage.jpg" width="500vw" height="200px;">
        <strong><p>Very very important! Whenever you go to a new page, please, please turn on the music. It gives the best experience. I promise, you won't regret it! </p></strong>
        <p>In the desolate year of 2075, the world lies in ruins, a scorched and scarred wasteland, the remnants of a civilization shattered by the cataclysmic force of nuclear war. Once-bustling metropolises have crumbled into skeletal remains, their towering structures now mere shadows of their former grandeur. Amidst this desolate landscape, amidst the dust and the echoes of a bygone era, you find yourself, a solitary wanderer, a survivor in a world teetering on the brink of oblivion. It seems you are living in a fallout and you need somewhere to go, desperately, or you might die... What do you do???
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Option 1:</h1>
        <p>
        You decide to traverse the treacherous terrain and explore the remnants of the Old World beckon you, their secrets whispering in the wind. Relics of a lost era lie scattered throughout the wasteland, tantalizing glimpses of a time when technology flourished and humanity stood at the pinnacle of its achievements. Yet, amidst these echoes of the past, a new reality has emerged, a world shaped by chaos, violence, and the primal struggle for survival. You gaze past your overlooking bunker. Just a barren and arid desert before you, do you explore to find the old remnants, perhaps to create a new life?
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Option 2:</h1>
        <p>
            Amidst this power struggle, whispers swirl of a mysterious courier, a lone figure who once held the key to the fate of New Vegas. Your memory comes back to you... You were a courier... And you were shot in the head, yet somehow survived. You don't know how you survived, but you are filled with a sense of revenge. You look around you, and find a small pistol, with 2 bullets left. Suddently, your vision goes blurry and things seem to be moving out of place. You need to make a decision fast. Do you chase this trail of unanswered questions and go after a legacy of intrigue?
