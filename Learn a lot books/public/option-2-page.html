        <h1>You've picked option 2...</h1>
        <img src="../src/ceasers-legion-image.jpg" width="500vw" height="375vh;">
        <p>With the resounding echo of the vault door sealing behind you, you take a moment to survey your bunker. Pistol gripped firmly in hand, equipped with only the essentials, you embark on a relentless pursuit to find the man who callously shot you. Whispers resonate in your mind, murmurs of a name — "Benny." Puzzle pieces start to fit together. The assailant was none other than "Mr. Benny," and your savior was a diminutive robot that nursed you back to health within the confines of your refuge.</p>

        <p>Fueled by an unyielding thirst for revenge, you make your way to Goodsprings, a neighboring city in a neighboring country. Addressing the citizens with a stern demeanor, you inquire, "Do you know who Mr. Benny is, and where can I find him?" The air hangs in suspense until an elderly man, weathered by time, points westward, accompanied by a solemn nod.</p>
        
        <p>You set forth on your journey and, as the landscape unfolds, you find yourself at the outskirts of what is known as Caesar's Region. Standing atop a vantage point, a mere few hundred meters away, you contemplate your next move.</p>
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h1>Option 1:</h1>
        <p>After careful consideration, you conclude that a direct confrontation is too perilous. Calculating the odds, you determine that forging an alternative path is the wisest course of action. The decision is made — establish your own faction. Building from the ground up promises a sturdy foundation for growth, albeit fraught with early-stage risks.</p>
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h1>Option 2:</h1>
        <p>Fueled by adrenaline, you cast caution aside and decide to go all-in. This moment feels like your singular opportunity before it slips away. The idea of creating a faction seems drawn-out, and you're convinced that time is of the essence. Your resolve solidifies as you prepare for a direct confrontation.</p>
