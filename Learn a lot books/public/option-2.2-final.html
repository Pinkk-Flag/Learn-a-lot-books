        <p>The citizens of Ceaser's region look at you oddly, but let you in because you seem like a beggar. You see a flourishing community, but your eyes are more interested in a more important thing. The biggest and more obstructive in the middle. As you enter the gates, some guards are already coming, and you feel it in your veins, it is time to go now. Rushing through the door, you sprints sets of stairs at a time, until you find a man, overlooking the city. He has an odd cap on his head, but fueled with rage, you take out your gun and fire a shot, clean at his head. And then his lifeless head slumped down. However, a man walks in. Your realise, the man you just killed was not Mr Benny, but rather, this man was. "You fool. You've run out of bullets. What now? Don't you realise it, I control everything. Including who wins, and who loses. Who lives and who dies." Your body unconsciously backs away and thump your head at the glass. Nowhere to go. Soon, men with guns follow next to him, all aimed at your head. It's over. <br><br> Your througt feels like it has a tennis ball stuck in your mouth, but you reach for your last bullet. You hear a gun cock, and suddently, it feels like time has slowed down. Gun in hand, you shoot Benny in the hand, and threw your gun and the window, and dramatically jump off. You skillfully roll and soak up the damage, as bullets fly from the ground. One even hits you in the chest, but that doesn't stop you. You are hurling ball of force, that has just defeated the greatest enemy in all of the Mojave Desert, and you have earnt everyone's respect. <br><br>Many months later, and you are known as the assasin of the Mojave Desert, hunting down any corrupt person for a hefty price, yet swift in action. You look back atop your humble abode as you sip on your cold whiskey, funded by the blood of traitors.
