        <img src="../src/C.I.T. Ruins image.webp" width="500vw" height="375vh;">
        <p>You trudge deeper, and you decide to embrace the call of the Old World's relics. But you keep walking. For days. Until eventually, a glimpse of hope shines in the distance. Your toungue feels like parchment, and your head is begging you to stop, but you keep meandering through the Mojave desert until you find... An abandoned city from the Old World. You come closer, it's called "C.I.T Ruins", though you don't know what it means, but it looks very promising. You become a wild dog. You scavenge for food, and eventually come across a worn down super market with some old water and you lap that down in an instant. Then, you gulp down the cans of beans and lick it dry. Your head no longer hurts, and all seems quite good... for now. Your resources are limited, and you could maybe last a month if you're conservative, so you need to do something fast. What should we do next??
        </p>

        <h1>Option 1:</h1>
        <p>
            You decide to create a new living. What this means, is that you become the leader of this new abandoned land and must build it up from the ground up. You hope that possibly, there could be some way to cultivate some crops, and rebuild your home once again, but it will take a long time, and it might pose serious risks. However, if this does play out to your favour, you would become the head of the most technologically advanced nations and could spark a new future for this distopian world you live in. Could you really get enough food in a month?
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Option 2:</h1>
        <p>
            Things seem a little too bleak. It is unrealistic you could get food in under a month. In this harsh reality, factions have risen, vying for control of the precious resources that remain. This might be your one way golden ticket back to life; possibly with a headstart. The New California Republic, a flickering beacon of hope for those who dream of rebuilding society, stands in stark contrast to Caesar's Legion, a ruthless empire ruled by an iron fist. You decide to play it safe and you pack some resources, and head over to The New California Republic society. Even though you may seem like an outcast, you still have the location and pictures of this abandoned city. Should you go for it?
