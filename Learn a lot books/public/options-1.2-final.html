        <p>You begin trekking off to The New California Republic, photos in hand, small backpack with food on your back and a proud smile painted accross your face. You keep in mind you have to dodge the land mines and you cautiously tread through the scorching Mojave Desert. Soon enough, you are at their gates, and you give a loud bang. A small, croaky voice responds, "What do want, Outcast!?" You respond, "You know what, I've found a new land, and I'll give it to you all if you give me free living here. That's the end of the deal." There is a pause. The doors open, and a man in a checkered suit greets you.. Hmmm, for some reason, this jacket looks familiar, but you couldn't exactly place your head on it. You are lead into a large Casino, with those flashing light bulbs all around the words "The Lucky 38". It feels quite ominous, but you continue anyways. You are guided into a closed room, just you and the strange man. "Names Benny", the man said in a friendly way. However, there was an itching sensation that this did not feel right. You continue anyways, besides, you've come this far. After some transversing, you both shake hands, and he gives you a special ticket. You feel proud, and he leaves the room, but gestures you to sit back down and slams the door shut, the quiet yet powerful sound of the lock following it. As you peer out of the small window, you see Benny and a few other men holding guns come closer. You've just realised your mistake...
