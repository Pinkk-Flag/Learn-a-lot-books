            For the sake of the practical assignment that I had to do, these buttons and links actually do not go anywhere. The only thing that <em>does</em> work is the portal for the choose your own adventure. While they obviously could be done (things such as the blog, pricing, etc), they were just a waste of time and practically did not contribute to what this assignment had wanted me to do. Also, the brands that I have put inside the index.html are not actually affiliated with me, I have just placed them there for show and in no means am I related to them for this project.<br><br>
            Sorry for the inconvenience!<br><br><br>
