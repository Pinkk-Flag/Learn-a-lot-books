        <p>You lay out the food in front of you. Hmm.. Not much, but it'll have to do. You rummage through the other buildings, an eerie silence creeps over you for the past few days, but you keep at it. Until you finally find some potatoes in an old sack! You plot out a small piece of land and begin work. Day and night, you keep toiling to keep on improving you life... And it has paid off. A month later, you have made your own food source, and you decide to trek out to begin building this community. 
        6 months later, a flourishing community has sprung. Rebuilding is in the work and society is prospering, whilst the other factions are slowly losing their power and influence as you become the pinnicle for growth. Eventually, after a year or so, the technology of the old world are finally discovered, and your "nation" has become the sole faction for growth. You sit on your chair, being the president of the New C.I.T and watch proudly as the world you know is being rebuilt...
