### What is it?
This is a 'choose your own adventure' story embeded into a SaS website landing page. While the only thing that works is the adventure software, the other parts could've definately been added (read fake.html for more info on why I did this).

### What did I learn?
This was a pivotal project where I was able to learn about many new CSS, html and Jquery, though it was mainly the CSS. This was my biggest CSS project I've ever done (500+ CSS lines) and it paid off. Got to know about @keyframes, animations, gradients and also how to efficiently code my stuff.

### What's next?
This will probably be the project that bridges my vanilla CSS to new Web Development projects, as I am planning on learning React, Tailwind CSS, etc in the upcoming months. I've already begun some Tailwind CSS, and that is likely what I will be doing next.
